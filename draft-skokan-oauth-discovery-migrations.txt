           OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata Migrations
             draft-skokan-oauth-discovery-migrations-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
   Metadata [RFC8414] to optionally indicate the availability of updated
   metadata and a mechanism for an OAuth 2.0 client to retrieve and use
   the updated metadata.  The updated metadata can be used for endpoint
   migration purposes or gradual rollout of new authorization server
   features.
